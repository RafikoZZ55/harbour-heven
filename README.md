# ⚓ Harbour Heaven

Harbour Heaven is a strategic idle harbour management game built with Flutter.

The game focuses on long-term planning, calculated risk, and passive progression. Players expand their harbour, manage fleets, send voyages, and grow their economy through strategic decisions rather than constant interaction.

## 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

Artificial Intelligence tools (including large language models) were used during development for:

- Improving text clarity and documentation
- Refining UI descriptions
- Fixing minor non-critical bugs
