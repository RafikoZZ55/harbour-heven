# ⚓ Harbour Heven

Harbour Heven is a strategic idle harbour management game built with Flutter.

The game focuses on long-term planning, calculated risk, and passive progression. Players expand their harbour, manage fleets, send voyages, and grow their economy through strategic decisions rather than constant interaction.

## 📌 Overview

Harbour Heven is designed as a slow-paced strategic experience where:

- Players check in once or twice per day
